											<h3>Camera Momentum + Impact</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											While swinging a sword, the camera will follow the swords motion to simulate momentum, and will also shake when the player hits an enemy.
											This is used to give the player a sense of impact, and to make the player feel like they are swinging a heavy weapon. 
											Each weapon has a different impact force, and the camera shake and movement is scaled to the impact force.
										</p>
										<p> Given the sword uses nodes across the blade to detect impact, one can simply check the direction moved between frames to determine how to sway the camera.</p></div>

												<h3>Music layering</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												All the music in Ballista was designed in a way to be layered together to create a more dynamic and interesting soundtrack. 
												While working with the composers I was able to create a system that would allow them to create a base track, and then add layers on top of it.
											</p>
											<p>
												Each track is played with 0 volume at start, and using an intensity point system the game can determine how much to raise the volume for each layer.

													<h3>Gyroscopic Aim Assist</h3>
												</header>
												<p>
													While aiming, you can fine adjust your aim by angling the mobile device you're playing on. This allows for more precise aiming, and is especially useful when aiming at a moving target.
												</p>
												<p>
													I couldn't get a good video of this as I do not have another camera to record my phone, but I can assure you it works. You can try it yourself by playing the game.

												<h3>Flowfield Pathfinder</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Instead of creating hundreds of paths and running hundreds of calculations, why not simply create a possible path amongst an area towards one?
												Although the initial run will be more performance costly, with a large number of simple actors and a less complex scene, you can gain some serious performance.
												The system was never finished, and it still has some scalability flaws, the next step would be to build chunks of each flowfield and use A* to pathfind along them.
											</p>
											<p>Best uses for this would be operating horde AI that generally all share the same general objective, things like zombie hordes!</p>

												<h3>Infinite Room Generator</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												A rather simple solution to linear maps, this system creates an almost maze-like structure by piecing together rooms in a random order.
												Each prefab room has a set number of doors that are used to generate any other room that will fit in that location.
												The approach to this system was a very occams razor approach, and it works very well while avoiding the need for a lot of complex calculations.
											</p>

											<p> This was initially being made for a "Backrooms" game, but I eventually opted to try something else.</p>

												<h3>Sunlight Bouncer</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												This system creates the illusion of Global Illumination by performing raycast bounces off of materials and inheriting the color of the material it hit.
												For each bounce it blends the colour of each surface it hit as well as saturating and darkening the colour to create a more realistic effect. At each bounce site it also
												creates a pointlight object with the current info of the light.
											</p>

											<p>
												This is a very performance heavy system and will not be usable outside of baked lighting. It requires a decent amount of work to get it to work with your scene, but it is
												but takes very little actual setup.

												<h3>AI Weakest Point Detection + Behavior Tree</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												This is less actual code and more utilizing a Roblox's own Pathfinding system with some minor tricks to make it work.
												The AI will find the thinnest part of an obstruction and target it to break through easier.

												<h3>BTrees External Tasks</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												This is a modification to tyridge66's BTrees module to allow for external tasks to be used. If you use Rojo to sync your project to Roblox Studio, you'll get benefits
												from connecting Rojo synced modules to the Behavior Tree system. This also allows for a much more modular approach to creating AI.
