												<h3>Smooth Menus</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Utilizing Fusion I was able to create a pretty simple menu system that can be easily modified and animated. 
												With everything decoupled and state itself being largely modified from outside the menu, it is very easy to add new menus and animations.
											</p>
											<p>
												This was made for my game: The Bucket, which isn't released yet.

												<h3>Swordplay & Polish</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												While swinging a sword, the camera will follow the swords motion to simulate momentum, and will also shake when the player hits an enemy.
												This is used to give the player a sense of impact, and to make the player feel like they are swinging a heavy weapon. 
												Each weapon has a different impact force, and the camera shake and movement is scaled to the impact force.
											</p>
											<p> Given the sword uses nodes across the blade to detect impact, one can simply check the direction moved between frames to determine how to sway the camera.</p>

												<h3>Flowfield Pathfinder</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Instead of creating hundreds of paths and running hundreds of calculations, why not simply create a possible path amongst an area towards one?
												Although the initial run will be more performance costly, with a large number of simple actors and a less complex scene, you can gain some serious performance.
												The system was never finished, and it still has some scalability flaws, the next step would be to build chunks of each flowfield and use A* to pathfind along them.
											</p>
											<p>Best uses for this would be operating horde AI that generally all share the same general objective, things like zombie hordes!</p>

												<h3>Infinite Room Generator</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												A rather simple solution to linear maps, this system creates an almost maze-like structure by piecing together rooms in a random order.
												Each prefab room has a set number of doors that are used to generate any other room that will fit in that location.
												The approach to this system was a very occams razor approach, and it works very well while avoiding the need for a lot of complex calculations.

											<p> This was initially being made for a "Backrooms" game, but I eventually opted to try something else.</p>

												<h3>AI Weakest Point Detection + Behavior Tree</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												This is less actual code and more utilizing a Roblox's own Pathfinding system with some minor tricks to make it work.
												The AI will find the thinnest part of an obstruction and target it to break through easier.
